# EX.-NO-2-B-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-RSA

## AIM:
  To write a C program to implement the RSA encryption algorithm.
  
## ALGORITHM:

  STEP-1: Select two co-prime numbers as p and q.
  
  STEP-2: Compute n as the product of p and q.
  
  STEP-3: Compute (p-1)*(q-1) and store it in z.
  
  STEP-4: Select a random prime number e that is less than that of z.
  
  STEP-5: Compute the private key, d as e * mod-1(z).
  
  STEP-6: The cipher text is computed as messagee *
  
  STEP-7: Decryption is done as cipherdmod n.
  
## PROGRAM: 

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
  Thus the C program to implement RSA encryption technique had been implemented successfully
